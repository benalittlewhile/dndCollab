# "The Svelte one"

My idea with this repo is to create a mockup/basic version of an app in svelte,
then have two of my mentees try to recreate the site in react as a way to learn
said react. I've included the original readme for the template I'm using below
to answer some architecture questions.

## Installation and usage

Requirements:

- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) - I'd recommend the latest version over
  stable
- [an npm-compatible package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/) - I use yarn, and
  I'll be writing docs as if you are too, but npm or other options are also
  available.
- git

Installation:  (in your finest terminal)
1. Navigate to your favorite repo folder
2. Clone the repository  
   `git clone git@github.com:benalittlewhile/dndCollab.git`
3. Change to the newly cloned folder  
   `cd dndCollab`
4. Check out the svelte version of the project  
   `git checkout svelteMock`
5. Install package dependencies  
   `yarn` or `npm install` or your package manager's equivalent
6. Start the dev server  
   `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`
7. Open up your browser and navigate to the localhost:port link shown on the
   screen. You should see the app!
8. Hackin'


# Svelte + TS + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Svelte and TypeScript in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Svelte](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode).

## Need an official Svelte framework?

Check out [SvelteKit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit#readme), which is also powered by Vite. Deploy anywhere with its serverless-first approach and adapt to various platforms, with out of the box support for TypeScript, SCSS, and Less, and easily-added support for mdsvex, GraphQL, PostCSS, Tailwind CSS, and more.

## Technical considerations

**Why use this over SvelteKit?**

- It brings its own routing solution which might not be preferable for some users.
- It is first and foremost a framework that just happens to use Vite under the hood, not a Vite app.
  `vite dev` and `vite build` wouldn't work in a SvelteKit environment, for example.

This template contains as little as possible to get started with Vite + TypeScript + Svelte, while taking into account the developer experience with regards to HMR and intellisense. It demonstrates capabilities on par with the other `create-vite` templates and is a good starting point for beginners dipping their toes into a Vite + Svelte project.

Should you later need the extended capabilities and extensibility provided by SvelteKit, the template has been structured similarly to SvelteKit so that it is easy to migrate.

**Why `global.d.ts` instead of `compilerOptions.types` inside `jsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.json`?**

Setting `compilerOptions.types` shuts out all other types not explicitly listed in the configuration. Using triple-slash references keeps the default TypeScript setting of accepting type information from the entire workspace, while also adding `svelte` and `vite/client` type information.

**Why include `.vscode/extensions.json`?**

Other templates indirectly recommend extensions via the README, but this file allows VS Code to prompt the user to install the recommended extension upon opening the project.

**Why enable `allowJs` in the TS template?**

While `allowJs: false` would indeed prevent the use of `.js` files in the project, it does not prevent the use of JavaScript syntax in `.svelte` files. In addition, it would force `checkJs: false`, bringing the worst of both worlds: not being able to guarantee the entire codebase is TypeScript, and also having worse typechecking for the existing JavaScript. In addition, there are valid use cases in which a mixed codebase may be relevant.

**Why is HMR not preserving my local component state?**

HMR state preservation comes with a number of gotchas! It has been disabled by default in both `svelte-hmr` and `@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte` due to its often surprising behavior. You can read the details [here](https://github.com/rixo/svelte-hmr#svelte-hmr).

If you have state that's important to retain within a component, consider creating an external store which would not be replaced by HMR.

```ts
// store.ts
// An extremely simple external store
import { writable } from "svelte/store";
export default writable(0);
```
